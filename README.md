Scripts and Data Files
Batch_PreProcessing_UAV.xml

This file is used for preprocessing UAV data in Agisoft Metashape.
BoxPlot.R

This R script is used for creating boxplots.
Processing_scatterplot_per_location.R

This script plots the relationship between GRVI and NDVI for each study area.

How to Use
Preprocessing UAV Data

Use the Batch_PreProcessing_UAV.xml file in Agisoft Metashape to preprocess your UAV data.
Creating Boxplots

Run the BoxPlot.R script in R to generate boxplots for your data analysis.
Scatterplot Analysis

For individual study areas, use Processing_scatterplot_per_location.R to plot GRVI vs. NDVI.
To analyze the combined data, use Processing_scatterplot_Gabungan.R for linear regression and Processing_scatterplot_Gabungan_Polynom.R for polynomial regression.
Acquiring Sentinel-2 Data

Use the Sentinel_2A_acquisition_GEE.txt script in Google Earth Engine to acquire Sentinel-2 MSI Level 2A data.
